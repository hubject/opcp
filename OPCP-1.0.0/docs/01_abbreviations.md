# Usage of abbreviations and acronyms in the API

To make the API more consistent, the casing of all methods and properties will get aligned to [camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case#Programming_and_coding). For acronyms and abbreviations applies:

> (…) treat abbreviations as if they were lowercase words and write "oldHtmlFile", "parseDbmXml" or "sqlServer". (Wikipedia)

<!-- theme: warning -->

> In Version 1 there are exceptions to this rule!
