# Publications and Repository Responsibilities

##	Repositories
In accordance with [VDE-AR](#list-of-abbreviations), the following repositories (except for OSCP and CRL) must be maintained to provide online access via a standard interface to certificates and related data for the participants of the ecosystem.

### The Root Certificate Pool [RCP](#list-of-abbreviations):
The Root Certificate Pool securely stores V2G-, OEM- and MO Root CA certificates participating in the PKI. The RCP operator verifies the authenticity of the root certificate owner before stroring them into the Root Certificate Root.

#### Fingerprint:
The fingerprint must have been authentically obtained via second channel from the corresponding root CA and must correspond to the fingerprint of the certificate.

#### Revocation:
The status of the Root certificate shall be confirmed by the owner of the root certificate company.

####	Requirements of ISO 15118
The certificate structure must comply with the specification in ISO 15118.

#### Restriction in access
Write access to the [RCP](#list-of-abbreviations) is restricted to certain employees and IT systems of RCP operator and requires authentication.

####	All activities at the [RCP](#list-of-abbreviations) shall be documented and archived.

### The OEM Provisioning Certificate Pool [PCP](#list-of-abbreviations):
The PCP securely stores the OEM provisioning certificate that is installed individually in each EV an OEM produces. Furthermore, the OEM Provisioning Certificate Pool stores the OEM Sub1-CA certificate and the OEM Sub2-CA certificate to allow signature verification along the OEM certificate chain. All certificates are stored together with the unique OEM provisioning certificate ID (PCID) that is also written in the subjectâ€™s common name field of the OEM provisioning certificate. 

###	The Contract Certificate Pool [CCP](#list-of-abbreviations):
The Contract Certificate Pool securely stores pre-compiled contractData which have been signed by the provisioning certificates as described by [VDE_AR](#list-of-abbreviations) and provided by a certificate provisioning service [CPS](#list-of-abbreviations). This data are ready to send in life time as certificateInstallationResponse message to the OEM or CPO.
